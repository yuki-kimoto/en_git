<h2> git merge --merge </h2>

You can merge with the "git merge" command. The argument of git merge is the commit ID, but <a href="/blog/20201220091244.html"> branch</a> is the name of the commit ID, and for everyday use, specify the branch name. And merge. The merge destination is the current current branch.

<pre>
git merge branch name
</pre>

<h3> What is a merge? </h3>

Merging is the incorporation of changes made to the source code.

For example, suppose you have a file called "a.txt" in my current main branch.

<b> Contents of "a.txt" in my current main branch </b>

<pre>
foo
bar bar
</pre>

Let's say Marshmallow worked and committed in a branch called "masu_fix_bug" that was derived from the "main" branch. And "a.txt" became as follows.

<b> Contents of "a.txt" in Marshmallow's "masu_fix_bug" branch </b>

<pre>
foo
bar bar
baz
</pre>

I want to include the contents of Marshmallow's "masu_fix_bug" in the "main" branch.

In such a case, the function called merging analyzes the difference and captures it. You can check the difference with the "<a href="/blog/20210805092910.html"> git diff</a>" command.

<pre>
git diff The name of the branch you want to merge
</pre>

<h3> Merge algorithm </h3>

There are multiple algorithms applied to merging.

<h4> Fast forward merge </h4>

The simplest merge algorithm. If a merge is possible by simply proceeding with the commit, this will be selected.

<h4> Non-fast forward merge </h4>

Merges the differences from the positions of the common ancestors of the two branches. Marges may conflict.

What surprises me here is that when merging, a command line editor such as <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20190401171737.html"> vi</a> is launched. am.

If there are no problems, switch to command mode with "ESC" and press "wq" "Enter" (save and exit) to complete the merge.

<h3> Resolving merge conflicts </h3>

If the merge conflicts, you need to resolve the conflict. In case of collision, the following will be displayed in the source code. I changed the path to "/ foo" and Marshmallow changed the text to "Good bye", so it clashed.

<pre>
Before the code

<<<<<<<< HEAD
<a href="/foo"> Hello</a>
=======
<a href="/bar"> Good bye</a>
>>>>>>> masu_fix_bug

Behind the code
</pre>

You need to think about what this part should be and fix it manually. Here is an example of a fix.

<pre>
Before the code

<a href="/foo"> Good bye</a>

Behind the code
</pre>

Now you have a content that correctly reflects the changes made by the two.

After that, use the <a href="/blog/20201112094521.html"> git add</a> command to "git add." And <a href="/blog/20201113141302.html"> git commit</a>. All you have to do with the command is the normal commit procedure to commit.
