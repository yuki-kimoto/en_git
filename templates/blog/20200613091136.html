<h2> Register the public key on Github </h2>

Register your public key on Github. If you register the public key, you can push / pull the Git repository with SSH protocol.

This article assumes that you are creating a private key on <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/"> Linux</a>.

<h3> Public and private key generation </h3>

First, change to the directory where you want to store the <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20200621103220.html"> SSH</a> private key. If the "~ / .ssh" directory does not exist, create it. The permission should be "700".

<pre>
mkdir -p ~ / .ssh
chmod 700 ~ / .ssh
cd ~ / .ssh
</pre>


To generate a public / private key pair, run the ssh-keygen command. The public key is a set with the private key, the private key is registered on the local machine, and the public key is registered on Github.

<pre>
ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>

You will be asked for the name of the file to be generated, so enter the following name.

<pre>
id_rsa_github
</pre>

The files "id_rsa_github" and "id_rsa_github.pub" will be created. "Id_rsa_github" is the private key and "id_rsa_github.pub" is the public key.

When you are asked to enter your passphrase, do not set a passphrase, so press Enter. Press Enter as you will be prompted to re-enter.

<h4> Private key permissions must be 600 </h4>

The private key permission must be 600. If created using ssh-keygen, the permissions will be set to 600, but if you have copied the contents of the private key from another server, <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi. Use the com / blog / 20200519082545.html "> chmod</a> command to set the permissions to 600.

<pre>
chmod 600 id_rsa_github
</pre>

<h3> Settings to use the private key created when connecting to Github via SSH </h3>

Let's set to use the private key created when connecting to Github by SSH. Add to "~ / .ssh / config". Let's also set the permission to 600.

<pre>
echo'
Host github github.com
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~ / .ssh / id_rsa_github
  User git
'| cat >> ~ / .ssh / config
chmod 600 ~ / .ssh / config

</pre>

<h3> Register the public key on Github </h3>

Register your public key on Github. Move from "Settings" of the user icon on the upper right.

<a href="https://github.com/join"> <img src = "/ images / github / github_user_setting_button.png" style = "width: 100%"></a>

Click SSH and GPG key.

<a href="https://github.com/join"> <img src = "/ images / github / github_user_setting_ssh_button.png" style = "width: 100%"></a>

Click New SSH key.

<a href="https://github.com/join"> <img src = "/ images / github / github_user_setting_new_ssh_key_button.png" style = "width: 100%"></a>

Enter the Title and Key. Title is optional and okay. Key is the content of "id_rsa_github.pub".

Let's display the contents of "id_rsa_github.pub" with the <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20200113083613.html"> cat</a> command.

<pre>
cat id_rsa_github.pub
</pre>

It will be displayed as follows.

<pre>
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCjSsucYA958wTIKUcPRXC2iZxb84FXkzm41 / jzpfnUeBFsypS8xfTXpfDaSIYeMDyr9pIUfDuWWPykoofL4WZaJYDy5pQclFwby / KttDRAnm0XZQ2ZDUtnrUUdva55mxOcTJP0c1VWXpwrhBA + JSFLOGB8wxCV8UFh9XWXI4c5QKQ / Hyl8 // nXT6suQf199VNf4Ru31rs + 49FDW9FyvoX1GGEEBJCT2ROVD6qi1xY766PuhM / 4OMQeIxZmZg8ysML307viqkKh / 2mecwkdV1mxGQt8GbO3gvTOX5h9p7tGEwa3zSHhxudux1Kf6Pfcg4FwKuld8r77DKMXEszpRI11 myapp @myhost
</pre>

Let's paste this value.

<a href="https://github.com/join"> <img src = "/ images / github / github_user_setting_input_ssh_key_button.png" style = "width: 100%"></a>

Registration is now complete.

<h3> Confirm that you can connect to Github by SSH </h3>

Make sure you can SSH to Github.

<pre>
ssh -T git@github.com
</pre>

If you haven't accessed the host yet, you'll be asked to allow communication, so type "yes" and press Enter.

It is successful when the following is displayed.

<pre>
Hi shinshina-kimoto! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
</pre>

Now you can push / pull with SSH.
